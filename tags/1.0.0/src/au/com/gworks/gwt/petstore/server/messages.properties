WelcomeServerController.about-info=<br/><p>This application demonstrates the use of GWT for the client and Spring for the middle tier, including declarative transaction management applied to POJO business objects.</p><p>This application can easily be configured to use JTA or JDBC for transaction management, so it allows declarative transaction management in a web container without JTA. The original Spring and Struts MVC model2 layers that were built on a shared Spring middle tier have been stripped from this distribution. Instead, the GWT MVC model3 layers were built on javaongems and gwt-widget server library (George Georgovassilis).</p><p>Note, this work is derived from Juergen Hoeller & Clinton Begin's JPetstore. </p><br/><b>Message to GWT widget builders:</b><br/> <p>In the spirit of the Zen Garden (see http://www.csszengarden.com/), if you have widgets that you would like to showcase in the gwt-Petstore, then please join the gwt-Petstore project and create an svn branch for your release. This enables all gwt-Petstore derivates to be co-located and the application of 3rd party widgets to be better understood under a common reference example. <br/><br/></p>
