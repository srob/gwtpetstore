 * <dhamma-message src="Atisha (11th century Tibetan Buddhist master)">
 *  The greatest achievement is selflessness. The greatest worth is self-mastery.
 *  The greatest quality is seeking to serve others. The greatest precept is continual awareness.
 *  The greatest medicine is the emptiness of everything. The greatest action is not conforming with the worlds ways.
 *  The greatest magic is transmuting the passions. The greatest generosity is non-attachment.
 *  The greatest goodness is a peaceful mind. The greatest patience is humility.
 *  The greatest effort is not concerned with results. The greatest meditation is a mind that lets go.
 *  The greatest wisdom is seeing through appearances.
